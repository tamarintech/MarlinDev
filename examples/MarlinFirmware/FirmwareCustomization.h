/*
 *
 *  Customization for a particular printer
 *

    Although you could define all of your customization here,
    the preferred procedure is to assign a unique id to each printer
    and place the customization for that printer in the customization area.
    You can then reference that file either from the command line or by defining the path here.


    If you have multiple printers, it is suggested that you create a file for each of them.
    You can then select one of them from a menu in the Arduino IDE.
    Please see ... for more information

    Even if you have only one, you can utilize that same mechanism to specify the id that you have assigned to that printer
    or, you could define it here *
